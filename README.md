##&lt;paper-date-input&gt;

`paper-date-input` is a  single-line text field with Material Design styling modified from `gold-cc-expiration-input`  
It only supports `YYYY-MM-DD` format for now.

### Validation

The input can check whether the entered date is a valid, future date.

The input can be automatically validated as the user is typing by using
the `auto-validate` and `required` attributes. For manual validation, the
element also has a `validate()` method, which returns the validity of the
input as well sets any appropriate error messages and styles.

See `Polymer.PaperInputBehavior` for more API docs.

### Styling

See `Polymer.PaperInputContainer` for a list of custom properties used to
style this element.
